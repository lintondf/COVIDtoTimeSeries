Why the focus on deaths not cases?  The problem with case statistics is that what is counted has changed nearly continuously since the start of the pandemic and continues to this day.  Early on, only patients sick enough to go to the hospital could be counted.  As tests came online (and eventually actually worked), people visiting a doctor could be tested and counted.  As of mid-2020, in the U.S., drive-up testing is more widely available, but since that involves the choice to undergo the unpleasantness of a deep nasal swab, current testing is by no means a random sample of the U.S. population.

The death statistics are not perfect.  Some claim conflating "dying of COVID-19" vs "dying with COVID-19" overstates death counts or that health care financing incentives favor overcounting.  Others say political incentives or incompetence motivate widespread undercounting.

I can not summarize the poor quality of the data better than [Willis Eschenbach](https://wattsupwiththat.com/daily-coronavirus-covid-19-data-graph-page/#001) when he threw in the towel on his own daily graph series:
> There are four important numbers in the game—positive tests, negative tests, hospitalizations, and deaths. Each has its own problems.

> The positive and negative tests used to refer just to detecting active cases. Now, however, we have test for both active cases and antibody tests to determine if someone has ever had the virus … and unfortunately, there’s no distinction in the data between these totally different tests.

> Hospitalizations were no problem when only corona patients were in the hospitals. But now that elective and other procedures are happening again, say some young guy goes in for a vasectomy. He gets tested, he’s not an active case but he has antibodies. So guess what? His hospitalization is now a COVID hospitalization. So they test his wife and two kids. They had it too, asymptomatic, but they’re now three more positive tests.

> Then there’s the problem of repeat testing of people who have the disease. If someone gets six tests, then it’s reported as six separate cases even though it’s only one case.

> Finally, the deaths. The CDC in its infinite stupidity has said to categorize a death WITH coronavirus the same as a death FROM coronavirus. They’ve also said that if a physician even SUSPECTS, not that corona caused the death but suspects that corona somehow contributed to the death … mark it as a death from coronavirus.

However, since the production of these charts is automatic I will continue to update them nightly.  My keys may be far away but the light is better under this street light.
